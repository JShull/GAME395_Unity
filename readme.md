## Course Description

GAME 395: Designing and Developing with the Unity Engine or as **[Dr. Moberly](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/k/kmoberly)** calls it *'Unity Zero to Hero'*. This class will take a Systems Engineering approach into how you can use real-time simulation systems aka ‘Game Engines’ to rapid prototype, create, build, compile, and deploy functioning software across major hardware and operating systems. This class will break down Unity into its core systems and will explore how said systems can be found in most game engines: including Unreal, Godot, & Stride. We will be using a wide range of software standards to explore and utilize well known programming patterns, concepts of software versioning, creating and maintaining changelogs, taking advantage of version control systems like git and importantly using distributed version control systems like GitHub/GitLab, dabble with cloud deployment architectures within Unity and PlayFab, work through package management solutions, and will take advantage of new machine learning tools and how they are rapidly changing how we work within platforms like Unity. The class will focus on one core project that students will continue to iterate on across the length of the class and is heavily designed around one day being dedicated to learning/teaching with the second day using the software. Whether you’re an expert in Unity or brand new to Unity, this class will help build confidence, make you familiar with the entire Unity environment and their ever expanding tools and deployment processes, and will provide information that directly helps towards the completion of a [Unity Certification](https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications).
