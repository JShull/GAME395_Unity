## Course Description

GAME 395: Designing and Developing with the Unity Engine or as **[Dr. Moberly](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/k/kmoberly)** calls it *'Unity Zero to Hero'*. This class will take a Systems Engineering approach into how you can use real-time simulation systems aka ‘Game Engines’ to rapid prototype, create, build, compile, and deploy functioning software across major hardware and operating systems. This class will break down Unity into its core systems and will explore how said systems can be found in most game engines: including Unreal, Godot, & Stride. We will be using a wide range of software standards to explore and utilize well known programming patterns, concepts of software versioning, creating and maintaining changelogs, taking advantage of version control systems like git and importantly using distributed version control systems like GitHub/GitLab, and work through package management solutions. The class will focus on one core project that students will continue to iterate on across the length of the class and is heavily designed around one day being dedicated to learning/teaching with the second day using the software. This class is best suited for those who already have a project in mind and the class can be thought of as you buying your own time to focus in on Unity. You have direct access to my experience and plan on using my experiences and skill-set to help you lift your ideas to successful Unity builds.
