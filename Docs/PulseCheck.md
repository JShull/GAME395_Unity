This is your contract, also known as a PULSE Check document. **P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with an optional one in the middle of the semester. It's tied to a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

### Unity Learn Pathway

Unity has great resources for their [Unity Learn platform](https://learn.unity.com/). A major portion of this class is utilizing those services, please identify which Unity Learn Pathway you want to explore and then how that pathway could help lead towards a potential certification opportunity later after this class.

> This is an **EXAMPLE**!!
>**Combination of Creative Core, Junior Programmer, and 3D-Kit Tutorial**
>
> Setup an account with Unity, go to the Unity Learn environment and look between the [Creative Core](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/creative-core), the [Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), and the [3D-Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/3d-game-kit) learning pathways. Come up with a combination of learning modules that work across these pathways - that will help build towards the more general developer certification. These pathways is what you will work on throughout the weeks and over the course of the class. You should expect to put roughly 30-40 hours in towards the Unity Learn system. At the end of the class you will be required to show that your Unity Learn pathway's have generated significant progress.
>
>**Unity Certification Interests?**
>This isn't required but some of the more advanced students in the past expressed interest in working towards a certificate.
>Interested in the [Game Developer](https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications) unity certification.
