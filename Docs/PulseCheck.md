**P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with ideally a 3rd check-in during the middle of the semester. It's based around a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

## Project Idea

In our first one-on-one meeting you will spend a couple minutes explaining your project idea, we will use these few minutes to make adjustments and scope it correctly while aligning it to a Unity certificate trajectory through using Unity Learn.

### Unity Certification and Unity Learn Plan

At the end of the certification route you have training materials and ultimately a certification test. Unity breaks them up into a few different categories - for the purposes of this class we are going to look at the two high level tracks for people coming into Unity with relatively zero experience.

- For the **Certified User**, Unity uses a certificate portal created by **Certiport**. Certiport is a company that helps Unity manage their Certified user trajectories. For these pathways I've included the PDF files, if you're curious you can explore details from [Certiport here](https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Educator-resources/Exam-details/Objective-domains?ot=collapseUnity).
- For the **Certified Associate**, Unity uses Pearson VUE Test Centers.
