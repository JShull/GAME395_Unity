This is your contract, also known as a PULSE Check document. **P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with an optional one in the middle of the semester. It's tied to a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

## Project Idea

In our first one-on-one meeting you will spend a couple minutes explaining your project idea and it's associated game kit that you will be modding, we will use these few minutes to make adjustments and scope it correctly based on your interests. We will also identify if you want to follow the Unity Learn Pathway or the Unity Software Package Pathway. Both will require some level of Unity Learn.

### Unity Learn Game Pathway

Unity has great resources for their [Unity Learn platform](https://learn.unity.com/). A major portion of this class is utilizing those services, please identify which Unity Learn Pathway you want to explore and then how that pathway could help lead towards a potential certification opportunity later after this class.

> This is an **EXAMPLE**!!
>**Combination of Creative Core, Junior Programmer, and 3D-Kit Tutorial**
>
> Setup an account with Unity, go to the Unity Learn environment and look between the [Creative Core](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/creative-core), the [Junior Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), and the [3D-Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/3d-game-kit) learning pathways. Come up with a combination of learning modules that work across these pathways - that will help build towards the more general developer certification. These pathways is what you will work on throughout the weeks and over the course of the class. You should expect to put roughly 30-40 hours in towards the Unity Learn system. At the end of the class you will be required to show that your Unity Learn pathway's have generated significant progress.
>
>**Unity Certification Interests?**
>This isn't required but some of the more advanced students in the past expressed interest in working towards a certificate.
>Interested in the [Game Developer](https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications) unity certification.

### Unity Software Package Pathway

Are you more geared towards coding and programming? Do you want to build Unity Editor tools? I am introducing this pathway in 2024 as I feel there are small select group of students who take this class who come with more advanced programming knowledge and/or have a background in Computer Science and/or have taken advanced mathematics via say an Engineering Degree program. This might suite your interests a little better than the generic Game Pathway option above.

In this pathway you will be required to host a Unity git standards project with supporting documentation, correct formats, correct changelog, samples, and have it be utilized in your 'mod' project. This is a more advanced pathway and I will work with you to better understand what its requirements will be as they will be more unique for each individual and their goals/needs. This will also a light load in Unity Learn - but probably more focused on the [programming Unity Learn Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).
