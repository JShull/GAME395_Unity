## Project Repository Format

Below is how your project should be formatted within the repository folder structure. Wherever you see 'Name' it's the naming convention we've been using for your project work: for example for myself, John Shull = 'JShull'.

## ChangeLog

I never developed a ChangeLog!

## PulseCheck Completion

All the pulse checks were marked off except for a few in the medium stake section. A lot of checke became irrelevant/unnecesary to my game design once my plan was changed from designing an entire game to just focusing on the basics of the building design. However, I did still study some of those components as I intend to use them as I further develop this game. Since I lack prior knowledge within Unity, it would takes me months to properly develop a singular compoent of a game and that is why there is not a submission from Unity itself!

## UnityCerts

I did not progrees furth enough in any Unity components to pursue a Unity Certification. However, I do intend to eventually pursue one!

### Final Document Header Format: 'Name'_Final.md

* Title- Into The Underground
* Project Abstract
  * Final Abstract:For my game design I will be utilizing many components of Unity. I intend to create a horror game that is centered around the premise of a building. You will journey through an eerie building as you attempt to escape with your lost friend. This project will utilize skills associated with the Unity Essentials Pathway. The main one being Unity's 3D design aspects. I intend to use Unity's visual scripting features as well. This pathway will also be associated with the development of a few game objects. The other pathway I will be utilizing is the Creative Core Pathway. It will teach me many mechanics that will be vastly involved in my horror style game. This pathway includes information about the basics of audio, visuals, and lighting. Lighting and audio will be very useful in adding to the creepy vibe of the game. The VFX Graph is capable of producing a lot of particles quickly helping to enhance the visuals. This will help add to the complexity and artistic values of my game. These are just a few of the skills associated with these pathways. The main core functions of my game will be basic movement and sprinting when in need(the UI system will help me apply these functions and many more to the game). Players will be able to interact with objects in order to progress throughout the game. The main goal of the game is to complete the task, find your friend, and escape the demons within! ( The Main goal/intentions of this project are to figure out how to utilize the vast assortment of components associated with Unity and how to use them in the game design industry)

Both project plan and Unity Learn milestones are somewhat innaccurate due game plan changes!
* **Project ScreenShots**
  Screenshots of my on paper work for my game design are provided within the Youtube video in the other submission!
* **Project Reflection**
  I honestly feel as if I am not quite on the other side yet. I have learned a lot about the Unity Software and how to utilize some of its components. However, I still have not quite figured out how to properly use the mechanics associated within Unity. This class helped increase my awareness of the vast components of design softwares but it will still take me some time to implement them due to my lack of experience.  My aha moment was likely around week 3. This is when I realized that I knew absoulutely nothing and that programming was actually very important! I did enjoy talking with industry professionals. It helped me realize how much hard work and dedication it takes to maintain a career in this industry. The only thing that I would have liked to have been done differently is something out of your control. You said that you believe this course should have pre-reqs and I could not agree more. This course felt as if it was more for a game design major as it was rather in depth (which is difficult for someone like me with no prior experience). I am proud that I actually stuck with the class and at least tried, unlike others apparently!
* **Project Next Steps**
  * If you were to continue on this project - what would you do next?
I intend to eventually release a demo that I have explained in another piece of documentation. However, learning how to fix/improve my building design is my actual next step. Without a functioning building there is no game!

### Contract Updates: 'Name'_ContractUpdate.md

Pretty Much my entire contract would have to updated as none of the steps were actually completed! However, I intend to maintain the same contract plan it will just take me a while as the information has not been coming easily to me. Especially since I am horrible at coding!
