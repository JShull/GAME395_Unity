Over the entire semester you've put in a lot of time, energy, and effort and this repository should reflect that. I am going to be looking through all of the material you submit. There are project folder structure requirements, there are simple readme.md files that are needed, your build will be included, your finalized unity project, and a final report will be included. I will only be evaluating your work on what you include in this repository. This is also your project, so feel free to include any additional content you want to include, just make sure you document that information within a readme.md located within the corresponding folder. Submission: a GitHub pull request where you request me as a reviewer. This final pull request should be you taking all of your work on your active develop branch and pulling it into the main branch.

## Project Repository Format

Below is how your project should be formatted within the repository folder structure. Wherever you see 'Name' it's the naming convention we've been using for your project work: for example for myself, John Shull = 'JShull'.

## ChangeLog

If you're doing a changelog, make sure you pick a standard and document your choice. For example, most of you are using: [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). In your changelog folder, just have your markdown file that contains your changelog information and include a simple readme.md that just explains what's in this folder 'This folder contains a changelog.md file based on <whatever standard>'.

## PulseCheck Completion

As I have eluded too a lot during the semester - the Pulse Check document was an original agreement template that we've now modified and adjusted for each individual person and your bigger project submission included references to this document. At this point this document has probably been modified a few different times over various commits and/or submissions. At this point you're now finalizing this document. Anything that you didn't feel that you did/understood and/or have no clue why it's here shouldn't be checked off but left unchecked. I am then assuming those items that you have left unchecked will have a 'ContractUpdate' to them. Those updates will be included in your FinalProjectSub folder.

## FinalProjectSub

The major piece of this submission is your 'Name'_Final.md markdown submission. Think of this markdown document as a massive summary of your entire semester's efforts and that it directly aligns with how we did the initial contract proposal. Which means you are going to have the exact same headers but also four new ones (new ones are in bold). Your markdown file should include the following headers in this order. If you have any additional files and/or content you are submitting, make sure to include readme.md files throughout each folder that needs additional explanation. The rest of this document is a breakdown of each piece of your submission.

### Final Document Header Format: 'Name'_Final.md

* Title
* Project Abstract
  * Final Abstract: can be the same as what your original agreement was... only if it still holds true!
* **Project Build Requirements**
  * How to play?
    * Input requirements (Keyboard, mouse, joystick, what buttons do what, etc.)
  * Build Environment Information
    * What were your Unity build settings?
      * Did you encounter any issues? what where they? How did you get around them?
* Unity Project Version and Unity Packages
  * This reflects your submission files and includes a list of all packages that are dependencies
* Project Plan Milestones
  * This should reflect your original agreement milestones with any modifications
* Unity Learn Milestones
  * This should reflect your original agreement learn with any modifications
* **Project ScreenShots**
  * Include images, gifs, videos, whatever you want that is digital and could later be used to help maybe for a portfolio. Go to town as much as you want and feel free to just link to another document/online portfolio of this work, whatever you want, but include some renders of your awesome work! Can be screenshots of code you're proud of, complete narrative walk-thru of your experience, whatever it is: long as it's connected to the project and it includes some sort of digital medium - toss it in here!
* **Project Reflection**
  * **MOST IMPORTANT PART**
  * Answer the following sets of questions in a paragraph form. Check for spelling and grammatical errors. Ideally this is roughly a page long but it can be as long as you need it to be. Feel free to include images, links to content, whatever you want that helps answer and address the questions below.
    * Now being on the other side, how do you feel about Unity?
    * Has this experience helped increase/decrease your capability within general software and/or Unity?
    * What was your ['aha' moment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) during this class?
    * Did you enjoy talking with industry professionals?
    * What would you have liked to have done and/or had me focus in on that wasn't covered in this class?
      * Feel free to throw criticism at me: I know I didn't get to everything and I know I glazed over some fundamentals, tell me so we can improve the next group coming behind you!
    * What are you proud of that you did for this effort?
* **Project Next Steps**
  * If you were to continue on this project - what would you do next?

### Build Zip: 'Name'_Unity.zip

This might cause some issues on storage - but we will address those as they come. After you have successfully done a Unity build. Unity dumps a lot of misc. files for your build and all build operating deployments are a little different, but all of those files are vitally important for me to run your project on another machine/server etc. You should have your build from Unity go to some folder you have on your computer - I would suggest copying that entire folder into another folder for this submission. Take that entire copy and include **one additional file: readme.md**! That readme.md should be: who created this build, build date, build version, machine information that the build was done on, what it's purpose was for (completion of a university class at ODU, etc.) and any information on how you 'Start' your game. Now that you have all of that in one folder - [zip that one folder which includes everything](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5) - and move that new *.zip file into your GitHub repository folder 'FinalProjectSub' and make sure it's named correctly.

### Contract Updates: 'Name'_ContractUpdate.md

If you have items that you didn't get to and/or had to change during the project, include the contract update template with the correct information filled out and make sure that you have that markdown file in this folder. Be aware that any image links might need to be updated and/or modified.

### Unity Project Folder

Your complete unity project should be included here. Most of you already have this as you've been using this repository as a working repository, which is awesome because for you it's basically done (just make sure you clean up your content as much as you can before submission). For the rest of you that have been off on the side working on your project - you need to get a functioning copy of your Unity project in this repository with the correct .gitignore. When I go to open your project using your final document information on Unity version and library references: there should be **zero errors**. If I run into a single *red* error that is not cleared on a Unity Editor restart: **it will be the equivalent of not hitting your final high stakes deliverable** and will result in the **A** being taken off the table and you will be at the **B** as the highest potential grade. If you know you're project is full of errors and you feel that it's too late in the game to address them, you've known the cost and the cost remains the same - and as the norm, please feel free to reach out to me to see if we can get that cleaned up! I will be able to help up until **December 9th**. Any requests for direct project help after December 9th will result in grade penalties directly related to the request.
