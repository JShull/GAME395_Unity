**P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with ideally a 3rd check-in by the end of the semester. It's based around a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

## PULSE Contract Revision

Main reason(s) for contract adjustment? Select all that apply.

- [ ] Project Overscope (Took on too much)
- [ ] Life Adjustment (Life got in the way - already discussed this with John)
- [ ] Didn't Keep to the Timeline (Just didn't stick to the plan)
- [ ] Other reason: Give me some details.

> If you selected Other: please provide those details below
>
> *DETAILS HERE*

## Main Adjustment Points

You understand that it's a give/take relationship with project work - you are putting a request to adjust your project means you're probably removing some work, of the work you are removing, how do you want to replace it and/or manage this change? Nothing is free... for every item you remove you must justify and add an additional item. Please provide the item from your original Pulse Check Document and then the new/modified request. **You can only append and replace Medium stake assignments and replace Unity Learn courses with other Unity Learn courses**

>**MEDIUM STAKE EXAMPLE**
>
>Original Pulse Check Item copied and pasted here:
>> **Medium Stake Assignment: 4. Game Design Program Patterns:** *[Message Event System Stack/Queue Event Listener](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/create-a-simple-messaging-system-with-events#) - in class with John*
>>
>> **REPLACEMENT:** Game Design Program Patterns: *[Double Buffer](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html)
>>
>> **JUSTIFICATION:** I realized that customizing the message event system wasn't needed and instead what I needed was a way to make sure I was storing a buffer of last read inputs.

>**UNITY LEARN EXAMPLE**
>
>Original Pulse Check Item copied and pasted here:
>> **Unity Learn Creative Core Pathway:** *[Cinemachine Learn](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/overview-of-cinemachine) - Using Cinemachine*
>>
>> **REPLACEMENT:** Unity Learn Programming Pathway: *[Programming with Interactions](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/creating-your-interactions)
>>
>> **JUSTIFICATION:** Originally I was going to have a really elaborate in-game camera system - I realized that this a feature that wasn't needed in my first version, what was more important for my game mechanic was understanding user interactions.

## The Eleventh Hour Change Request

You are in a serious bind... you probably did this to yourself... you're thinking you need to withdrawal but you figured *'What's the worse that could happen?'*

> If your in this situation and you haven't talked with me at all this semester you are in a very unique case in which all of my previous attempts to make sure you weren't falling behind didn't catch you. You can make attempts to plead your case with me but let's assume you ghosted and now came around ;). In order to fix this: you need to immediately schedule a meeting with me and you and I are going to come to an agreement. Understand that this option removes the ability to get an A in the class. We are now looking at the maximum grade as a C. Given that this is a topics class, getting a C is really the equivalent of a failed attempt. I offer this as a safety mechanism as I've been here before and I never had this option. The University system is different than when I went to school - to make sure that the work that the other students have put in isn't put in vain I have to reduce the opportunity for you to get a higher grade. This is a last resort and *will* require **A LOT** of effort. This isn't an easy route to take, this will require a lot of time, it will require a lot of writing, a video recording, accessibility features, demonstrate something in Unity, a clean powerpoint presentation, and a written report with graphics. Hint: you will have to present a multi-medium presentation and a justification to your fellow classmates at the end of the semester. I understand that this might be difficult and/or terrifying for some of you: unfortunately there is no other option as up until this point the average time on this class that everyone else has put in, roughly 70-90 hours on the low-end. Do the math - it's not fun and runs the risk of jeopardizing your other classes... but hey this is where you are and this is what it takes sometimes. **Up for it?**
