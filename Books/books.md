# Book Materials

I believe in using as much open source and/or creative commons free to use content as possible. I also support most of the individuals that I share if they do have paid options but I don't pass the cost onto the students as there's no reason to spend the money to learn this material.

## ProGit

This book has *a lot* of version control information associated with git and I will not be going into this book at all. I put it here for those who want to deep dive and become git magicians. I know you exist and this is for you.

## Game Programming Patterns

This book I will be pulling from for Software Program Design Patterns. The author, Robert Nystrom, has the entire book online for free on his [website](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). If you did want to purchase this book you can also do that and [get it here at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906). You can also find [Robert Nystrom on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/munificentbob). This class is not a *programming class* but I will be covering programming concepts and going into some of the code - worry not I will also be providing my own custom code for you to use as Unity Packages throughout the class. Which means you get to build experience using Unity packages and helping contribute on open-source projects :rocket:!
